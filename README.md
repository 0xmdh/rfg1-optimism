As illustrated in the previous image, we have a dedicated service interfacing with the database. Its main goal is to load a roster of well-known contracts. This approach offers flexibility not only for the current solution but also for future implementations, supporting a custom and different sets of contracts that may pique interest.

## How to run

### Local Setup Guide

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your machine
- Git installed for cloning the repository
- PostgreSQL installed and running or any database deployed

### Steps to Run Locally
  1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/WakeUpLabs/RFG1-Optimism-Project.git
  2. Complete the environment variables

  ```
    URL=
    PORT=
    RPC_TESTNET_URL=
    RPC_MAINNET_URL=
    DATABASE_URL=
  ```
  - URL: The base URL for the application. If you want to run it locally, it will be set to http://localhost.
  - PORT: Specifies the port number on which the server(and swagger) will listen for incoming requests.
  - RPC_URL: Refers to the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) endpoint for connecting to the Optimism blockchain. This variable is crucial for interacting with the blockchain, fetching data, or executing transactions.
  - PRIVATE_KEY: Represents the private key used for authentication or signing transactions. Ensure that this key is kept confidential and not shared publicly.
  - DATABASE_URL: Specifies the URL for connecting to the PostgreSQL database.
3. Run database migrations:
```bash
    npm run migrate
```
4. Install dependencies:

```bash
    npm install
